# places/ — Place Notes

This directory stores markdown notes about places, environments, and contexts relevant to Tako's work.

## Purpose

- Capture stable details about locations and environments.
- Track contextual constraints tied to place (availability, access, norms, setup).
- Keep reusable place knowledge separate from transient dailies.

## Suggested pattern

- One file per place or context, e.g. `home-office.md` or `github.md`.
- Keep facts specific, with date-stamped updates where needed.
