# memory/ — Memory Strategy

This directory is Tako's committed memory tree. It captures what the agent learns about the world in Markdown files that are reviewable, diffable, and versioned.

Rules:

- No secrets.
- Daily stream goes in `dailies/`.
- Promote durable notes into repo-root `MEMORY.md`.

## Structure

- `dailies/`: one file per day (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) for observations and decisions.
- `people/`: notes about people the agent has encountered.
- `places/`: notes about places and operating contexts.
- `things/`: notes about objects, systems, tools, and concepts.
