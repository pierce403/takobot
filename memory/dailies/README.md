# dailies/ — Daily Memory Logs

This directory holds day-by-day logs of what Tako observed, attempted, and decided.

## Guidelines

- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Keep entries concise and factual.
- No secrets (keys, tokens, private credentials, or sensitive personal data).
- Promote durable takeaways into `../MEMORY.md`.

## Purpose

Daily logs are the raw memory stream. They are not the canonical durable memory; they are the source material for it.
