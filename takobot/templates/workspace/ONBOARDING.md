- [ ] Daily log exists at `memory/dailies/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- [ ] Stage is set in `tako.toml` under `[life].stage`.

- [ ] Purpose captured.
- [ ] XMTP handle prompt completed (`yes/no`), then pairing or explicit local-only choice.

## Stage Progression

- [ ] Child stage world-learning routines are active (world watch, notebook, briefings).
- [ ] Stage transition is logged in `memory/dailies/` and persisted to `tako.toml`.

## Runtime

- [ ] Inference runtime is available (pi required).
- [ ] `doctor` runs offline diagnostics.
