# people/ — Person Notes

This directory stores markdown notes about people encountered by Tako.

## Purpose

- Track stable identity/context details that help with continuity.
- Preserve long-term relationship and preference notes.
- Separate person-level memory from daily operational logs.

## Suggested pattern

- One file per person, e.g. `alice.md`.
- Include date-stamped updates and confidence when facts are uncertain.
- Link back to relevant daily logs when provenance matters.
