# resources/ — Resources (PARA)

Resources are execution-facing reference material.

This is not `memory/` (durable agent memory).

Conventions:

- Prefer small Markdown files over large docs.
- Link resources back to related projects/tasks when useful.
- Deterministic world-watch notes now live under `memory/world/`.
