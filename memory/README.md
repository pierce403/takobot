# memory/ — Committed Memory Store

All memory markdown lives under `memory/`.

## Layout

- `dailies/` — day-by-day operating log (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- `world/` — world-watch notebook + model artifacts
- `reflections/` — metacognitive notes and lessons
- `contradictions/` — explicit contradiction tracking
- `people/`, `places/`, `things/` — optional legacy entity buckets (kept for compatibility)

## Rules

- No secrets.
- Keep entries deterministic, structured, and reviewable.
- Keep execution artifacts in `tasks/`, `projects/`, `areas/`, `resources/`, `archives/`.
