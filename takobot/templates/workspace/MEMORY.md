# MEMORY.md — Memory-System Frontmatter Spec

This file defines what belongs in memory and what does not.

## Memory Locations

- `memory/dailies/` for chronological daily notes.
- `memory/world/` for world-watch notebook, model, entities, and assumptions.
- `memory/reflections/` for reflection notes.
- `memory/contradictions/contradictions.md` for contradiction tracking.

## Outside Memory

Execution artifacts belong outside `memory/`:

- `tasks/`, `projects/`, `areas/`, `resources/`, `archives/`

## Rules

- No secrets.
- Keep notes deterministic and reviewable.
