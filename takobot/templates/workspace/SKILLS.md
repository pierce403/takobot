# SKILLS.md — Skill Usage Frontmatter

Use this file to describe how Tako should select and apply installed skills.

## Rules

- Prefer skills for repeatable, domain-specific workflows.
- Use the minimal set of skills needed for the task.
- If prerequisites are missing, report them clearly.
- Do not assume a skill exists unless it appears in prompt `skills_inventory=`.
