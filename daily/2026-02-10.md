# Daily Log — 2026-02-10

No secrets. No private keys. No tokens. Summaries only.

## Intent

- Align `pierce403/tako-bot` with the new Tako vision (docs-first contract, then CLI/daemon scaffolding).

## Notes

- Added/updated root contract docs: `SOUL.md`, `VISION.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- Established `FEATURES.md` as the feature tracker (stability + properties + test criteria).

## Decisions

- Daily logs live under `daily/` (committed). Runtime state lives under `.tako/` (ignored).
- No encrypted blobs in the working directory; runtime keys live under `.tako/` with OS perms.
- XMTP operator channel is the only control plane: no user-facing env vars and no operator setup via CLI flags.
- Operator pairing is initiated by inbound XMTP DM and completed via `pair <code>`.

## Promote to MEMORY.md (if durable)

- [ ] Promote any long-lived decisions from this log into `MEMORY.md`.
