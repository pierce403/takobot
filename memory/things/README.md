# things/ — Thing Notes

This directory stores markdown notes about systems, tools, objects, and concepts Tako interacts with.

## Purpose

- Capture practical knowledge about artifacts in the agent's world.
- Track how tools/systems behave over time.
- Provide reusable reference notes outside of daily logs.

## Suggested pattern

- One file per thing, e.g. `xmtp.md`, `tako-runtime.md`, or `farcaster.md`.
- Note assumptions and known limits clearly.
