# resources/ — Resources (PARA)

Resources are reference material you want to keep around.

This is not "memory/" (durable agent knowledge). This is execution-facing reference for the operator.

## Conventions

- Prefer small Markdown files over big docs.
- Use clear titles and add links back to related projects/tasks when useful.
- `world/` is reserved for deterministic world-watch notes (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) and mission-review snapshots.
