# projects/ — Projects (PARA)

Projects are outcome-based commitments with a clear finish line.

## Conventions

- Keep one project per Markdown file (or a folder if it needs sub-artifacts).
- Prefer short, concrete names that read well in task metadata.
- Every active project should have a "next action" somewhere (usually a task in `tasks/`).

## Suggested Shape

`projects/<project>.md`

- Goal / definition of done
- Current status
- Links to relevant tasks
- Notes (optional)
